# Synchronization-task
The script synchronizes the content between two derectories, source one and replica one.
Namely, it compares the content (names) in directories and copies files and folders, in case it are absent in replica directory,
and removes files and directories from replica in case if it are not present in corresponding source directory.
When comparing files, it takes into account not only names but its content also via 'filecmp.cmp' method.

INPUTS:
path to source directory
path replica directory
number of synchronization sessions
interval between sessions

OUTPUTS:
returnes messages which reflect number of session and all provided operations, such as copying, removal, replace of a file/folder
creates a log-file in the derictory of script-file, which contains all returned messages.

POSSIBLE TROUBLES:
"Access denied" when you have no access to some files/folders
Differently tilted slashes are used to specify directory pathes, namely "\", "/" or even "\\", that  can cause error
